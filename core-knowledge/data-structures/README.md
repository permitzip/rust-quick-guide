## Ownership

Rust is known for a feature called ownership.&#x20;

Ownership offers memory-safe guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

Ownership rules:

* Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its _owner_.
* There can only be one owner at a time.
* When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

In the context of [Rust functions](../functions-and-extensible-features/#ownership), Ownership is easier to contextualize.
