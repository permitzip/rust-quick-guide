# Functional Language Features

Rust is heavily influenced by _functional programming_. This often includes using functions as values by passing them in arguments, returning them or other functions, assigning them to variables for later execution, and so forth.

The primary areas of focus in this section are

* **Closures** - a function-like construct you can store in a variable
* **Iterators** - a way of processing a series of elements
* **Pattern Matching** and **Enums** as they relate to this paradigm.
