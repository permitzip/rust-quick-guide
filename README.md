{% hint style="info" %}
This document is no more than a summary of high points from the comprehensive documentation of [The Rust Programming Language 2018 edition.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)&#x20;

This is a derivative work. Much of the language is taken word-for-word what is published on the official Rust documentation listed above.&#x20;

I've merely consolidated the data into a quick-reference manual that hopefully will encourage more developers to learn about Rust.

All credit of this work belongs to the authors, Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols as well as the Rust Community contributions.

### How to Use This Guide

This book is intended to be a trimmed-down version of the official documentation that would allow curious minds to review the examples and core concepts quickly without getting bogged down too much in any one topic.&#x20;

Rust is such a comprehensive shift in programming though and so this summary hopes to serve as a fast way to grasp core concepts and fundamentals.

Each chapter includes the examples that were most impactful for me in understanding the concepts. More time is given to Rust-specific concepts like ownership, generic types, traits, lifetime, etc.&#x20;

This book is broken into two main categories

* Intermediate
* Advanced

This did not include beginner (aka setup tutorial etc) because the original website is suitable for those needs.

### Who am I?

* I'm an electrical engineer with a piano degree that runs an MEP consulting engineering firm called [PermitZIP](http://www.permitzip.com).&#x20;
* Started studies in software development= March 2021
* I prefer self-study over educational institutions...which is why this document exists.&#x20;
* Hopefully, it's useful to you - please feel free to contribute when it
  * increases clarity
  * increases simplicity
  * corrects typos

Happy hacking!
