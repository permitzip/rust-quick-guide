# â›µ About

A few high impact notes from the comprehensive documentation of [The Rust Programming Language 2018 edition.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

note: this is not original work, what is shown in this book is often word-for-word what is published on the website. I've just consolidated it into a quick reference manual. All credit of this work belong to the authors Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols as well as the Rust Community contributions.
